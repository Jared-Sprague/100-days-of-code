### Day 18: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Got the C++ srt-game-server building!!! Update it's README with the steps for Fedora 33.  Also added a config.yaml file and yaml file parsing for config.  Also fixed the config strategy for the server to allow any config to be overriden with command line arguments, defined in config.yaml, or default value in that order.

**Thoughts:** Crazy getting back int C++! I felt like I was back in collage in the mid 90's.  We really take for granted the ease of installing dependancies via a central repository like npm.  In C++ there is nothing like that, and everything has to be compliled to the right architecture that you're running on.

### Day 19: February 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first pull request for the srt-game-server! C++ style

**Thoughts:** Felt really good to get this working after 17 years of not touching any C++ code.  I viewed this as a challenge and was able to beat it.

**Link to work:** [Pull Request](https://github.com/redhat-gamedev/srt-game-server/pull/14)

### Day 20: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Fixed up a 3 year old Phaser3 base project to use for LD in April

**Thoughts:** I found a nice minimalist Phaser3 foundation project with a gulp build with babel.  I had to do some work to get the build working with the latests versions of dependancies.
